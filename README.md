# DOSELTA
DOSELTA - Data Oriented, Small and Efficient c++ Library for Task Automation.

The Description:
DOSELTA is a library helping you to write applications for your simple tasks.
You can quickly write an app that will go through some data, process it, and
give you some output, if you wish. DOSELTA is great for creating little
projects requiring data storage, such as diaries, or lists of ideas.

Be careful though - don't delete the .doselta files! Otherwise you will lose
all of that data permamently.

Actual Purpose:
Basically, I created this library just for myself; I just needed to make simple
little applications, (such as diaries, TODO lists, password storages, etc. ) so
I created this "shortcut" for them. This project isn't meant to be used by
anyone, but if you like it, and you would like to "upgrade" it a little, feel
free to pull request your changes!
