THE CHANGELOG OF DOSELTA


(v1.0.0) The original version:
- This is a Data Oriented, Small and Efficient c++ Library for Task Automation.


(v1.0.1) (16.3.2022) Minor fixes:
- Added the changelog file.
- It won't log whether the DOSELTA_DATA directory exists or not at the beginning of the run anymore.
- Made it C++14-friendly; removed the <filesystem> include, replacing it's commands with system("mkdir DOSELTA_DATA") instead.
- Made it even more non-windows OS hostile; system("") can only be used on windows.

(v1.0.2) (16.3.2022) Minor fixes:
- Added removePage() for the BookFile class.
