THE CHANGELOG OF DOSELTA


(v1.0.0) The original version:
- This is a Data Oriented, Small and Efficient c++ Library for Task Automation.


(v1.0.1) (16.3.2022) Minor fixes:
- Added the changelog file.
- It won't log whether the DOSELTA_DATA directory exists or not at the beginning of the run anymore.
- Made it C++14-friendly; removed the <filesystem> include, replacing it's commands with system("mkdir DOSELTA_DATA") instead.
- Made it even more non-windows OS hostile; system("") can only be used on windows.


(v1.0.2) (16.3.2022) Minor fixes:
- Added removePage() for the BookFile class.


(v1.0.3) (19.3.2022) Medium fixes:
- Added the NOPFX macro.
- The NumbersetFile and BookFile won't push their first value into a file immedaitely after the write() function
  is called, the write() function checks if the size of their value vector is higher than 0 (empty) first.
- Fixed the signed/unsigned mismatch warning; in input_handler.cpp, the argIndex variable was defined as a normal
  integer, and later compared with unsigned-integer values. ArgIndex is defined as an unsigned integer now.
- Removed macros.h, because that file was actually useless to the library.
- Removed some redundant semicolons at the end of macros' definitions in DOSELTA.h
- Including the binary .lib file of DOSELTA on GitHub now.
